# Project Swar - Deployment Guide

This guide covers all deployment options for Project Swar, from local development to production deployment on various platforms.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Local Development
```bash
# Setup development environment
chmod +x scripts/setup.sh
./scripts/setup.sh

# Start development servers
./start-dev.sh
```

### Docker Deployment
```bash
# Simple local deployment
chmod +x scripts/deploy.sh
./scripts/deploy.sh

# Production deployment with nginx
./scripts/deploy.sh deploy production
```

## üì¶ Deployment Options

### 1. Local Docker Development

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker 20.10+
- Docker Compose 2.0+

**Commands:**
```bash
# Deploy locally
./scripts/deploy.sh deploy development

# Check status
./scripts/deploy.sh status

# Stop services
./scripts/deploy.sh stop

# Cleanup
./scripts/deploy.sh cleanup
```

**Access URLs:**
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000
- API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs

### 2. Production Docker with Nginx

```bash
# Deploy with production configuration
./scripts/deploy.sh deploy production
```

This includes:
- Multi-stage builds for optimization
- Security headers and GZIP compression
- Health checks and monitoring
- Non-root containers for security

### 3. Cloud Platform Deployments

#### Vercel (Frontend)
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Set environment variables:
   - `REACT_APP_API_URL`: Your backend URL
   - `REACT_APP_WS_URL`: Your WebSocket URL
3. Deploy automatically on push to main

#### Railway (Full Stack)
1. Connect repository to Railway
2. Railway will auto-detect the `railway.toml` configuration
3. Services will be deployed automatically

#### Render (Full Stack)
1. Connect repository to Render
2. Import the `render.yaml` configuration
3. Set up environment variables as needed

### 4. Kubernetes Deployment

**Prerequisites:**
- kubectl configured with cluster access
- Container images built and pushed to registry

**Commands:**
```bash
# Deploy to Kubernetes
chmod +x scripts/k8s-deploy.sh
./scripts/k8s-deploy.sh deploy

# Check status
./scripts/k8s-deploy.sh status

# Port forward for local access
./scripts/k8s-deploy.sh port-forward

# Cleanup
./scripts/k8s-deploy.sh cleanup
```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

#### Backend
- `ENVIRONMENT`: production/development
- `LOG_LEVEL`: info/debug/warning/error
- `PORT`: Server port (default: 8000)

#### Frontend
- `REACT_APP_API_URL`: Backend API URL
- `REACT_APP_WS_URL`: WebSocket URL
- `PORT`: Server port (default: 3000)

### Build Configuration

#### Backend Dockerfile Features:
- Multi-stage build for size optimization
- Tree-sitter grammar compilation
- Non-root user for security
- Health checks
- Production-ready uvicorn configuration

#### Frontend Dockerfile Features:
- Node.js build optimization
- Nginx serving with custom configuration
- Security headers
- GZIP compression
- Health checks

## üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`) provides:

### Automated Testing
- Python backend tests with pytest
- TypeScript frontend type checking
- Linting and code quality checks

### Security Scanning
- Trivy vulnerability scanning
- Dependency security checks

### Container Building
- Multi-platform builds (amd64, arm64)
- Automatic tagging and versioning
- Push to GitHub Container Registry

### Deployment Triggers
- Automatic deployment on push to main
- Manual deployment workflows available

## üìä Monitoring and Health Checks

### Health Endpoints
- Backend: `GET /health`
- Frontend: `GET /health`

### Docker Health Checks
Both services include built-in health checks that monitor:
- Service availability
- Response time
- Resource usage

### Kubernetes Monitoring
- Liveness probes for automatic restart
- Readiness probes for load balancing
- Resource limits and requests

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Container Security
- Non-root user execution
- Minimal base images
- Security header configuration
- Dependency vulnerability scanning

### Network Security
- CORS configuration
- Security headers (CSP, XSS protection)
- HTTPS configuration options

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Tree-sitter Build Errors
```bash
# Ensure build tools are available
apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential

# Manually rebuild languages
cd backend
python -c "from tree_sitter import Language; Language.build_library('build/languages.so', ['vendor/tree-sitter-go', 'vendor/tree-sitter-javascript'])"
```

#### Docker Memory Issues
```bash
# Increase Docker memory allocation
# For Docker Desktop: Settings > Resources > Memory

# For production, adjust container limits in docker-compose.yml
```

#### Port Conflicts
```bash
# Check what's using the ports
netstat -tulpn | grep :3000
netstat -tulpn | grep :8000

# Kill conflicting processes or change ports in configuration
```

### Logs Access

#### Docker Logs
```bash
# View all service logs
docker-compose logs -f

# View specific service
docker-compose logs -f backend
docker-compose logs -f frontend
```

#### Kubernetes Logs
```bash
# View pod logs
kubectl logs -l app=swar-backend
kubectl logs -l app=swar-frontend

# Follow logs
kubectl logs -f deployment/swar-backend
```
